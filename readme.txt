Have you ever wondered how many news event are produced every day in Europe? 

To demonstrate the real-world applicability and feasibility to perform real-time distributed data analytics, we connected DIAS into GDELT to measure the number of news events in Europe, updated every 15 minutes. Such news events are a good indicator of the overall activity level of the continent. Indeed, if more news items are being produced, then it is likely that more physical events are taking place. And vice-versa.

The following application connects DIAS into GDELT. GDELT is the largest publicly available collection of near real-time news feed in the World, connecting to hundreds of newsfeeds and delivering updates every 15-minutes. 

This DIAS application covers the 28 countries in Europe. Each country is represented by a DIAS node, so there are 28 DIAS nodes in the network that are cooperating to provide analytics about th
